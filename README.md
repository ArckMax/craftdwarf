Project about procedural generation of items in a fantasy world.

In a heroic-fantasy world, the crafts of the dwarves are famous. Any of the resources provided by nature can become a magnificent object giving wealth, a magic sword changing the fate of the world or a weapon that can cause chaos.

You, the student of the Great Craftsman Brum, have to face your greatest challenge : the exam to obtain the official title of dwarf craftsman.

Create your own items with what you have in your workshop, and maybe one day you'll be the next "Great Darven Craftsman".

Now, only the Blacksmith job is available. Several other jobs are planned, such as cooking, leatherworking, jewelery, etc.

Features planned : 

- Sales system between users (With a currency system, allowing the discovery of new rare materials or enchantments)
- More jobs
- Exploration, Archeology system for discovering items (Famous items made by other players ?) 
- Procedural generation of a story attributed to an object. For example, a sword may have been forged by a famous dwarf, have been lost in the battle against an Ancient Demon, and discovered during an exploration in ruins. It would also be possible to display the various owners of the object, if it has been sold.
- Clan creation : Maybe create by players or procedural generation.
- Historic background generation
- Religion system with beliefs, Pantheon major and minor gods 
- Magic : Elements and spell, and several jobs linked => Chaman, Wizard, etc.

This could be a part of a bigger game in the future or a small app. 

This application has no commercial purpose but only educational. Maybe a version will come out in the future with bigger goals.

Ideally, this application will be provisioned by the community.

This project is clearly inspired by the game Dwarf Fortress, http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/ .
